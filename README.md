# MNIST-Quantum-Neural-Network

Three primary investigations are carried out in this
project to compare the performance of a binary classification task using quantum machine learning. First,
we performed image encoding using different approaches,
including basis encoding, amplitude encoding, and
FRQI(Flexible Representation of Quantum Images)
encoding. Second, we compared how the depth of the
ansatz circuit can affect the model performance. Third,
we compared the performance using different optimizers
to compute the gradient.
